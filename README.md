# Super Kit Rust code for Raspberry Pi

This is a [Rust] version of the lessons from the [Sunfounder]'s
[Super Starter Kit V2.0 for Raspberry Pi].
This kit is compatible with Raspberry Pi 4B/3B/3B+/2B/B+.

## About The Code

All the code has been test using a [Raspberry Pi 4 Model B], also known as
RPi 4B, with 4GB running [Raspberry Pi OS], August 2020 version.
Either the 32-bit or 64-bit version should work.
Other Linux distributions that support RPis should work but haven't been tested.
Feedback from anyone that tries the lessons on other distros is welcome.

Idiomatic Rust is used as much as possible while still trying to look much like
the Python code used in the lessons.
The C code for each lesson was also used as a reference during development.
